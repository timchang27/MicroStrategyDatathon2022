## Dataset
### Data Science Jobs & Salaries
Contains data on job postings for data science-related jobs in California

## Problem Statement
231 billion US dollars â€“ thats how much the Data Science Industry is worth today, with this number expected to grow annually by 13.2%. The demand for Data Science Professionals has surged over the years with many flocking to pursue a degree in Data Science. California hires the most by far, but there exists a huge mismatch between Data Science Graduates and Job Postings. This leads to higher company turnover resulting from career misalignment, lower employee satisfaction, and resource wastage. To solve this problem, SkyOne Analytics presents: JOBR.IO, the data driven career portal for Data Science.


## Our Approach

JOBR.IO offers a deep dive into job postings in the form of a Dossier, a collection of Data Visualisations organised into Chapters and Pages. 

- Overview of the Data Science Job Market
  - Graduate Employment Survey (Compound Grid)
  - Breakdown of Data Science Job Postings by City and Role (Heatmap)
  - Comparison of Median Salaries across each job (Bar and Line Chart)
-  Comparison of Data Science Domains (e.g. Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analytics) (Hybrid)
-  Job Search and Salary Comparison Page using Dynamic Filters (Hybrid)
-  Overview of Qualifications required by each Data Science Domain and Role (Hybrid)
  - Analysis of the most in-demand Qualifications in the Market (Sankey Diagram)
  - Connected Qualifications and Domains (Network Diagram)
- Overview of Company Benefits
  - Most Prominent Company Benefits (Word Cloud)

- Filters have been used to narrow down relevant insights on the California job market, and also help job seekers find suitable roles near them. 
- Qualifications and benefits sections to ensure the right fit for Data Science Graduates
- Machine learning to recommend suitable job postings for aspiring data scientists.
